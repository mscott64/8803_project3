There is one Makefile in the root folder.
"make all" will make the client, rpc, proxy, and server executables.
The executables made are client_ex, rpc_ex, proxy_ex, and server_ex.

Usage:
./client_ex [-h hostname]
	    [-p port_num]
	    [-r num_requests]
	    [-t num_threads]
	    [-f num_files]
./client_ex -u prints the usage
