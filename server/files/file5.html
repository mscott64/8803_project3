This is my test file for project 1. It doesn't really say anything, I just wanted to make it a medium-sized document. Now I am just going to transcribe the dialog from the tv show that I am watching. She is proud of him. I wonder what that feel likes. Dear Shelly, that's what she calls him, Shelly. That's her petname for him. Do you know what my mother's petname for me is Leonard? First of all, the projects were totally different. I'm ready. Right, our guest of honor, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Alright, you people ready to have some fun? Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side. A neutron walks into a bar and asks "how much for a drink?". The bartender replies, "For you, no charge." Okay I am done.
